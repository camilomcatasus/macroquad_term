# ***TERMINAL WEBSITE***

You're looking at it!

Every about section under **projects** is written in markdown, so is my resume.
The markdown is parsed and rendered to a buffer of chars which is then drawn to the screen.

  **How**

Most of the website is built in **Rust** using *macroquad* as a sort of game engine. 
I initially tried to get a project built with *ratatui.rs* and *xterm.js* to work but the complexity overwhelmed me eventually.
So I built a fake terminal renderer in macroquad, using its simple api for drawing to the screen. 

I'm using trunk to serve all my static files.

  **Issues**

After trunk compiles rust to wasm, it adds a nonce to the end of the file name. 
This makes it difficult to target the wasm from javascript, which is needed for macroquad.
To resolve this I had to create a utility that gets the name of the wasm file and rewrites 
the javascript in the index.html to point to the wasm file.
